<h1>Angular</h1>

<p>
 Angular is a frontend framework for creating medium and enterprise level Single Page Applications (S.P.A.) that uses TypeScript instead of javascript.
 <br>
 Frameworks can be generally divided into two main categories:
 <ul>
  <li>Configuration over convention</li>
  <li>Convention over configuration</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 Configuration over convention means that a framework comes pre-packed only with the bare essential. An example of this is React. React is easy to approach and has an easier learning courve because doesn't come with many things already configured. If a react application needs state management one's has to install redux or flux. Same goes with routing. This makes it easier to learn because you are learning only react and this other libraries can be learned later when there is the need.
</p>
<p>
 Convention over configuration frameworks are instead already pre packed with everything and they are more difficult to learn because you have to approach everything at the same time. Angular is one of those. It comes with pre-built routing and state management. It uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript which is an additional roadblock for a developer who hasn't used much static languages. This, apparently negative, traits make this kind of framework more suitable for very large application. Once one is accustomed with them it becames very easy to speed up the developing process and build something scalable. The aim of Angular is to have scalability and production and development as its core to deploy robust applications that can be used by millions of users.
</p>

<h2>The angular CLI</h2>
<p>
 The angular CLI is the official Angular tool to configure correctly and hassle free all the tools needed to develop an application. It offers many capabilities through the cli and is used for handle how the various tools are angular uses, TypeScript, SASS, Babel and other work together. The most common use cases are:
 <ul>
  <li>Build a project</li>
  <li>Test it</li>
  <li>Deploy it</li>
  <li>Create reusable components</li>
 </ul>
 The CLI is, in short, a bundling tool to connect everything together.
 <br>
 All the needed information about the the CLI tool can be found in the official documentation <a href="https://angular.io/cli">here</a>.
 <br>
 The angular CLI can be installed through NPM with
 <pre><code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code></pre>
 Now that it is installed the keyword <code>ng</code> will perform any needed angular related command
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<h3>Creating a new project</h3>
<p>
 Starting a new angular project is very easily done with the angular CLI.
 <br>
 By typing <code>ng new</code> we can create a project and by adding <code>--help</code> at the end of every <code>ng</code> command you can see every possible flag option for it.
 <br>
 When creating a new project two questions will be asked by angular:
 <ol>
  <li>Would you like to add Angular routing?</li>
  <li>Which stylesheet format would you like to use?</li>
 </ol>
 The first question, obviously, adds routing to the application. Based on your needs may or may not needed. For a beginner is better to select no and to install it later if needed. The second questions prompts use to four different choices between: SASS, LESS, SCSS and CSS. For a beginner normal CSS will be more than enough. 
 <br>
 After those two options the bootstrapping of the project will start and once completed you'll already have a working application.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading Angular</h2>
<p>
 Angular receves a new version every six months. To stay up to date and be sure that you're following the lastet relases the angular developer made the <a href="https://update.angular.io/">angular update guide</a> with all the steps needed to successfully migrate from one version to the other.
</p>
<p>
 Angular CLI also offers a way to update easily. Between every new release there is a command that automatically updates every component of the project. To upgrade from the version 14 to 15 the command is <code>ng update @angular/core@15 @angular/cli@15</code>. Be aware that this command can be used only to migrate to the next version. This means that you can't migrate from 13 to 15 but from 13 to 14 and finally 15 is possible. This command is present, with the related version, on the angular update guide. Follow the website instructions to be aware of any possible needed change.
</p>

<h2>The default server</h2>
<p>
 To start your application in development and see how it behaves and to test it angular comes with a preconfigured server. This server is useful for development purposes but is not suitable for production and any significant amount of traffic will break it easily. The server can be started with the command
 <pre><code>ng serve</code></pre>
 The command will generate the following output:
 <b>insert here first image</b>
 Now the application will be available on your machine on the port number 4200 (this port is the angular default) and visiting the URL <code>localhost:4200</code> in your browser the default angular app will be rendered and it will look similar to this:
 <b>insert here second image</b>
 to stop the built-in server from running press <code>CTRL + C</code>
</p>

<h2>Compilations & Platforms</h2>
<p>
 ALl of the code we write in Angular using TypeScript will be compiled to JavaScript. The angular's feature that make it the framework that it is are not native to JavaScript and will be converted into it and to do so angular compiles its code. There are two ways to compile our code and although the result will always be the same the how changes drastically due to how it impacts performance.
</p>

<h3>Just In Time (JIT) compilation</h3>
<p>
 This compilation strategy angual will compile the TypeScript code and once finished the browser will download everything. The compiler too.
 <br>
 Once that everything is downloaded the project will still divided into various javascript components and the compiler will work so that the browser can understand the code and once the process is finished the application will start to run.
</p>

<h3>Ahead Of Time (AOT) compilation</h3>
<p>
 In AOT compilation the code of the whole application will be compiled into javascript (this passage happens both in JIT and AOT compilations) and once the conversion will be finished it will finish to compile the various components of the application so that everything is ready and doesn't need additional loading time when the browser finishes to download the application. Additionally, the compiler doesn't get downloaded with this compilation. 
</p>

<h3>Compilations comparison</h3>
<p>
 <table>
  <tr>
   <th>Angular</th>
   <th>JIT</th>
   <th>AOT</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Size</td>
   <td>Larger size: needs to load the compiler too</td>
   <td>Smaller size: everything is already fully compiled</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time</td>
    <td>Slower: the compiler needs to run in the browser</td>
    <td>Faster: everything is ready to be run</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Errors</td>
   <td>Errors will be catched in the browser</td>
   <td>Error will be catched in the server</td>
 </tr>
 </table>
 AOT compilation is relatively new to the angular ecosystem with it being introduced with Angular 9 and it become the recommended compilation. JIT is still used to maintain compatibility with the old systems that still use it.
</p>

<h3>Platforms</h3>
<p>
 A platform is how Angular understands the environment and it determines the compilation strategy. <code>platformBrowserDynamic</code> uses JIT and <code>platformBrowser</code> uses AOT.
 <br>
 By default Angular is going ro recommend using <code>platformBrowserDynamic</code>. This because the due to how the two platform functions are made they can be used interchangeably. It is recommended to use the first so to be able to switch to JIT compilation but angular, by default, will use AOT.
 <br>
 To load a platform just the import in the <code>main.ts</code> file is needed:
<code><pre>
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
platformBrowserDynamic();
</pre></code>
 This code loads just the platform but not the application. To load the application angular creates a default module. A module is a piece of code that connects thing together. Going into the project at <code>src/app/app.module</code> we can see the basic module that connects the whole application together.
 <br>
 To bootstrap the application this module needs to be loaded into the platform:
<code><pre>
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

// import the app module
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
</pre></code>
 This code loads the application which will be now visible, by default, on <code>localhost:4200</code> but the method <code>bootstrapModule()</code> returns a promise. This gives the possibility to log any error. The default way would be to simply log them:
<code><pre>
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';


platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
 .catch(err => console.log(err));
</pre></code>
 Creating a new angular application, this piece of code will be exactly what is in the <code>main.ts</code> and although it's already there and works it's important to know how it works under the hood
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Angular</h2>
<p>
  The building blocks of angular are <b>components</b>. Components are organized into <b>modules</b>, pieces of code that collects components in a functional set to connect everything together. As we already saw every application has, by default, a root module that bootstraps the project, it can be found in <code>app.module.ts</code> under the <code>/src</code> folder and is called <code>AppModule</code>.
  <br>
  A module can import other modules to export their functionalities and to make them available to other modules too. An example is the <code>Router</code> module that enables the changes of components based on the URL.
</p>
<p>
  A component defines a <i>view</i>, a section of the UI that renders specific UI elements and is defined using HTML templates and through property bindings can display the component data and react to triggers like buttons and alikes while the component handles the data and the logic.
</p>
<p>
  A component can use a <i>service</i>. A service is a class used to share resources and behaviors across components like HTTP requests and authentication. They can be injected as dependencies through dependency injection.
