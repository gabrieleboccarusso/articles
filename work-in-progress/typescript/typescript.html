<h1>TypeScript</h1>
<p>
 TypeScript is a super set of JavaScript and is built on top of its features. The TypeScript language is not designed to improve the security, scalability or speed of an application but to ease the work of the developer. It makes an application way easier to debug and design.
</p>
<p>
 Writing some JavaScript is easy and when put in a browser it just works but with TypeScript you need to install a <i>compiler</i> that converts TypeScript to JavaScript. This because all the code that we write in TypeScript is just JavaScript but with more feature that allow a better design and decrease the chanches of a logical error.
</p>
<p>
 TypeScript can be download via npm with the command <code>npm install typescript</code>. for more details there is the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/download">official website</a>
</p>
<p>
 Every typescript file ends with <code>.ts</code> and can be run with <code>npx tsc file.ts</code>
</p>

<h2>Type Annotations</h2>
<p>
 typescript adds type to JavaScript. this is its main feature. Let's see a basic function in TypeScript:
 <code><pre>
function add(a: number, b: number) {
 console.log(a + b);
}

// this will give an error
add('2', 2);
// this not
add(2, 2);
 </pre></code>
 it is possible to force a return type to the function itself too:
 <code><pre>
// will give an error because it needs to return a number
// function add(a: number, b: number): number {
// console.log(a + b);
// }

function improvedAdd(a: number, b: number): number {
 return a + a;
}

// this will give an error
// add('2', 2);
// this not
console.log('result: ' + improvedAdd(2, 2));
 </pre></code>
 If you run the last piece of code with <code>npx tsc file.ts</code> there will be no output but now a new file has been created in the same directory: <code>file.js</code>.
 <br>
 Running <code>node file.js</code> will output
 <code><pre>
result: 4
 </pre></code>
 Taking a look at <code>file.js</code> we'll see this:
 <code><pre>
// will give an error because it needs to return a number
// function add(a: number, b: number): number {
// console.log(a + b);
// }
function improvedAdd(a, b) {
 return a + a;
}
// this will give an error
// add('2', 2);
// this not
console.log('result:' + improvedAdd(2, 2));
 </pre></code>
 Although this is the same exact code using typescript in a large application will be immensely useful to <i>ensure that your code will do what you want it does</i>.
</p>

<h2>Union Types</h2>
<p>
 By default TypeScript lets a variable of a specific type but it is also possible to add multiple types through the pipe operator: <code>|</code>.
 <code><pre>
// this will give no error
let middle_name: string | null = null;
 </pre></code>
 With the pipe operator we can infer multiple types not just to a variable but to anything: functions, arrays, objects, etc.
 <br>
 There is also the <code>any</code> type. This type lets the container of the data be anything possible and is generally not a good practice because nullifies the power of typescript although it may be useful for certain kind of unusual operations.
</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>
 In TypeScript arrays are usually set to <code>any</code> by default but with a bit more logic this is easily avoided and can show how powerful it can really be:
 <code><pre>
// this is of type any[]
let arr = [];

// if we fill it it gets automatically a type
// this is of type string[]
let arr2 = ["myString", "anotherString"];
 </pre></code>
 By using multiple types in an array it will by default get set on those type with the pipe operator:
 <code><pre>
// under the hood
// this is the same
let anotherArr = ["a string", 67];
// as
let anotherArr: (string | number)[] = ["a string", 67];
 </pre></code>
 In the last line of code the pipe operator has been used is a parenthesis. This allows an overall cleaner code. For an array doing <code>arr: (string | number)[]</code>or <code>arr: string[] | number[]</code> is the same.
</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>
 An object in TypeScript, as we have already saw, can infer the data type by default if initialized:
<code><pre>
const person = {
 age: 10, // type is number
 name: "John" // type is age
}</pre></code>
 we can also declare an object as a variable so to define its properties:
 <code><pre>
const person: {
 age: number,
 name: string
} = {
 age: 10,
 name: "john"
}</pre></code>
 we can also have undefined types which are optional. They are declare with the <code>?:</code> keyword:
 <code><pre>
const person: {
 age: number,
 name: string
 driver_license?: string // this is valid
} = {
 age: 10,
 name: "john"
}</pre></code>
 Creating an array of objects is possible but not with what we have
 <code><pre>
// this is an array of generic objects
let people: {}[];</pre></code>
 To tidy things up TypeScript uses <i>interfaces</i>.
